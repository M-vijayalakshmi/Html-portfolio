<h3>Harry Potter series</h3>
<p>This is my all time favourite fantasy movie series. I like each and every series. I like dobby, hagrid, harry and hermoine characters. I like the wand in the movie. So cute...</p>
<h3>The jungle book</h3>
<p>This movie is about the little boy who is living the jungle where the wild animals were living. He is in under care of Blank panther. Fighting scenes with The king lion is one of the thrillest scenes and a good story with nice acting.</p>
